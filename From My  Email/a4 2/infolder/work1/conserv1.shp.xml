Certain scale datasets are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modelling purposes.  Please be sure you are using the best available data.

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the county level.  1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such as property parcel boundaries.

1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the multi-county or regional level.  1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be considered suspect.  Make sure you are familiar with your data before using it for projects or analysis.  Every effort has been made to supply the user with data documentation.  For additional information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact section of this documentation.  For more information regarding scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:  http://geoplan.ufl.edu/education.html.  These data are based on interpretation of available information and should not be construed as legally binding.</attracce></qattracc><qattracc><attracce>BLOCK GROUP (as defined by US Census Bureau) A block group consists of all census blocks having the same
first digit of their four-digit identifying numbers within a census tract. For example, block group 3 (BG 3) within a census tract includes all blocks numbered from 3000 to 3999. BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. BGs on American Indian reservations, offreservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 300 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workerüs dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) Most BGs were delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureauüs Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local, state, or tribal government declined to participate or where the U.S.
Census Bureau could not identify a potential local or tribal participant. 
BGs never cross the boundaries of states, counties, or statistically equivalent entities, except for a BG delineated by American Indian tribal authorities, and then only when tabulated within the American Indian hierarchy (see TRIBAL BLOCK GROUP). BGs never cross the boundaries of census tracts, but may cross the boundary of any other geographic entity required as a census block boundary (see CENSUS BLOCK). 
In decennial census data tabulations, a BG may be split to present data for every unique combination of American Indian area, Alaska Native area, Hawaiian home land, congressional district, county subdivision, place, voting district, or other tabulation entity shown in the data products. 
For example, if BG 3 is partly in a city and partly outside the city, there are separate tabulated records for each portion of BG 3. BGs are used in tabulating data nationwide, as was done for the 1990 census, for all block-numbered areas in the 1980 census, and for selected areas in the 1970 census. For data presentation purposes, BGs are a substitute for the enumeration districts (EDs) used for reporting data in many parts of the United States for the 1970 and 1980 censuses and in all areas before 1970. Also, BGs are the lowest level of the geographic hierarchy for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulates and presents sample data.</attracce></qattracc></attracc><logic>Relied on the integrity of the attribute information within the original data layer.</logic><complete>Relied on the integrity of the attribute information within the original data layer.</complete><lineage><srcinfo><typesrc>MAP</typesrc><srccurr>Publication date</srccurr><srccontr>Spatial and Attribute Information</srccontr><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</origin><pubdate>2000</pubdate><title>US CENSUS BLOCK GROUPS - 2000 </title></citeinfo></srccite><srcscale>1:100,000</srcscale><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2000</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>publication date</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>US CENSUS</srccitea></srcinfo><procstep><procdate>2003</procdate><procdesc>GeoPlan during the QA/QC process included the following aspects:

GeoPlan in shapefile format from ESRI (http://www.esri.com/data/download/census2000_tigerline/index.html).
When received, data was in Geographic projection, Datum: NAD83, Spheroid: GRS1980,
Units: Decimal degrees.  The data was then projected to FGDL Albers HPGN.
